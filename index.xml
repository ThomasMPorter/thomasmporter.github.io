      <description>The song Still Alive in the Classic Valve game Portal has the lyric:
 &amp;ldquo;We do what we must, because we can&amp;rdquo;
 I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a better way to describe what I&amp;rsquo;m about to present.
Nobody needs to run Encarta 96 in a virtualized Windows 95 environment, unless there is a very particular need to feel nostalgic for mid-1990s computing.
So Then, Why Exactly? It started with a Tweet by @shanselman that got people taking about pre-internet Wikipedia, otherwise known as Microsoft Encarta:</description>

      <description>A video about Buzzwords by yours truly!
  I recorded the shorter version of one of the presentations I‚Äôve pitched for a few calls for papers (it hasn‚Äôt been accepted yet üôÅ). It‚Äôs not much, but hopefully the start of something: The Buzzword Economy https://t.co/p0hu6hW01g

      <description>It took a hot minute, but I finally got an Azure Pipeline to deploy my hugo source to GitHub Pages.
It isn&amp;rsquo;t pretty, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to write something without using pieced together marketplace tasks (if possible), but I&amp;rsquo;ll take what I can get for now!
I hope I can use this as a way to test out and share knowledge.
Here&amp;rsquo;s Hoping..</description>

      <title>Why I Stuck With Roku After Trying FireTV</title>

      <description>TL;DR: Amazon FireTV is a great platform, but it does not have an (official) application to access our UltraViolet Library. Too much focus on Amazon content and Ads.
Our household has been using Roku devices exclusively for many years. We recently we got the opportunity to see what it‚Äôs like to use an Amazon FireTV 2. I was curiously to see what we‚Äôve been missing.
As a background, we use quite a few services: Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Vudu, HBO Now, Starz, PlayStation Vue, and YouTubeRed.</description>

      <description>So, I‚Äôve been a Microsoft .NET programmer for over ten years.
Ten years.
In this decade of coding professionally:
 I haven‚Äôt blogged about programming. I‚Äôve barely tweeted about it. I haven‚Äôt contributed to one open source project. I haven‚Äôt answered one forum post or Stack Overflow question. I haven‚Äôt attended a local .NET user group.  I‚Äôm not bragging. Looking back, I wish I had done more outside of work.</description>
